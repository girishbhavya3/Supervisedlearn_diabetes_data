# Diabetes Dataset Analysis Using Supervised Learning Algorithms

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of the diabetes dataset using various supervised learning techniques. It involves the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest algorithms, along with exploring the explainability of the Random Forest model for better understanding its predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the "Diabetes" dataset, containing information about diabetes patients. It includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and diabetes indicators. The dataset is available from [source/link].

## Implemented Algorithms
## SVM
The SVM algorithm has been implemented to classify and predict outcomes based on the diabetes dataset.
## Random Forest
The Random Forest algorithm has been employed for prediction and analysis.An explanation of the Random Forest model's results has been included for enhanced interpretability

## Future Works
Implementing other supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression, neural networks, etc.
Enhancing the explainability of models implemented.
Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Visualizations and further analysis on model predictions.
